The Box_Rest_Client is a simple way to access the Box.net ReST API through PHP. 

## Dependencies
As of 5.1.2 SimpleXML is enabled by default unless you turned it off. 

- cURL: http://us3.php.net/manual/en/curl.installation.php 
- SimpleXML: http://us3.php.net/manual/en/simplexml.installation.php
- PHP Version 5.3.x (This is the only version it has been tested on. If it works 
on other versions, please let me know)


## How does it work?
The `Box_Rest_Client` provides a standard way to execute various api methods from 
the Box API.

Rather than providing "aliases" to the box.net api, the client completely relies 
on the api_methods. Except in a few cases (authentication, folder_tree, etc.) you 
will mostly be calling the api methods directly. 

This happens through the use of the get()/post() methods which accept an API 
method as well as any parameters that need to be passed. For example, to use the 
get_account_tree api method you would do something like the following (note, the 
example assumes you have already set an api_key and authenticated a user).

  $box_rest_client = new Box_Rest_Client($api_key);

  $box_rest_client->get('get_account_tree',array('params[]'=>'nozip'));

Of course there are "aliases" for commonly used api methods to ensure that you 
don't need to do a lot of work to get up and running with the box.net api. 

For more details and some code examples, take a look at the example.php file. 

## Aliases
Aliases are simply methods with the Box_Rest_Client class that can be run to 
perform a series of actions instead of forcing you to run through a series of 
api-methods manually. 

### Authentication 
_replaces[[get_ticket](http://developers.box.net/w/page/12923936/ApiFunction_get_ticket),[get_auth_token](http://developers.box.net/w/page/12923930/ApiFunction_get_auth_token)]_
To authenticate a user simply set the api_key and then do the following
```$box_rest_client->authenticate(); ```

The authentication will kick in and get a token, which it will use to redirect 
the user to the box.net login screen where they will need to grant your 
application permission. Once that is complete, they will be redirected back to 
your callback page. From there, you can do what you want. 

What happens with the auth_token that is received from the completion of the 
authentication process is handled via the `Box_Rest_Client_Auth->store()` 
method. By default it simply returns the `auth_token`, but you could 
theoretically set it up to do whatever you wanted to make the auth_token 
publicly available. 

After you have the auth-token, you will need to provide it to the 
`Box_Rest_Client` class every time.


### File/Folder list
_replaces[[get_account_tree](http://developers.box.net/w/page/12923929/ApiFunction_get_account_tree)]_
Since the `get_account_tree` api method returns a result structure that varies 
based on the setup of a certain directory, the get_account_tree api method is 
aliased as `$box_rest_client->folder(0)`. 

That will instantly return a list of files/folders below the folder wth id 0. 
It will also ensure that the folders/files are of type `Box_Client_Folder`/`Box_Client_File` 
respectively. These provide a standard interface for accessing properties of 
the files and will eventually mean that we can add individual features to it.

By default it only does a first level tree listing, but this can be changed by 
modifying the 2nd params argument. 

	$box_rest_client->folder(0, array('params' => 'nozip','simple'));
